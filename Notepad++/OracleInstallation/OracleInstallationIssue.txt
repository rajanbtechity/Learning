1. After installing oracle i was not able to connect to oracle when trying to login as SYS. It gave error as
"ora-12543: tns:destination host unreachable"

This was because of @ in my password. Used password as "rajankumar@20".

2. Renamed password to "rajankumar" using following steps

conn / as sysdba
alter user sys identified by rajankumar

3. Now you would want to connect as sys. we have another problem

  conn
  sys
  rajankumar
  
  it gives error as
  ORA-28009: connection as SYS should be as  SYSDBA or SYSOPER
  
4. So now we have to connect SYS as SYSDBA. Syntax for same is below

connect sys/ as sysdba
rajankumar

5. hr user is by default locked. To unlock hr user use below command.

 ALTER USER hr ACCOUNT UNLOCK;
