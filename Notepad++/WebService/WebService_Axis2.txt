1. Creating Webservice using Axis2

   1.1 Download Axis2 jars and extract it somewhere in the system.(Downloaded axis2-1.7.7-bin)
   1.2 Add Axis2 jars to eclipse.
   1.3 Create Dynamic web project.
   1.4 Add WebService class to the project.
   1.5 convert webservice class into webservice using Axis2 implementation.
   1.6 Axis2 belongs to jax-ws specification and jax-ws has given some annotation like @webservice,@webmethod,@webparam 
       which eclipse would take care.
   1.7 http://localhost:8010/SoapWebServiceAxis2/ -->service-->get the wsdl
	   
   Error Details while creating webservice using axis2.
   1. current verison of axis2(1.7.7) doesn't support dynamic web module version heigher than 2.5
   2. From Axis2 1.7 onwards, Eclipse fails to copy xmlschema-core library to the project. 
	  It will throw NoClassDefFoundError: org/apache/ws/commons/schema/resolver/URIResolver when you run the project. 
	  To avoid this exception, copy the xmlschema-core-x.x.x.jar file from $AXIS2_HOME/lib folder to the 
	  Eclipse project directory WebContent/WEB-INF/lib.
	  
	  
2. Create Webservice client using Axis2
   
   2.1  Create Dynamic WebProject or normal java project.
   2.2  Generate stub in src folder for which we need wsdl url.
        If we are using wsdl url, service must be running. If using physical wsdl file service being up is not required.
   2.3 	Added xmlschema-core library in WEB-INF lib folder.
   2.4  stub will be created in src folder. For each method in webservice call, one inner class will be created inside stub class.
   2.5  create inner class object and set parameters to be passed to the method using inner class object
   
        CalServiceStub stub = new CalServiceStub();
		
		CalServiceStub.Add param = new CalServiceStub.Add();
		
		param.setI(40);
		param.setJ(50);
		
		stub.add(param); - It returns response of Type CalServiceStub AddResponse innner class type.
		CalServiceStub.AddResponse rsp=stub.add(param);
		
		For fetching the output need to use get_return() method;
		int result=rsp.get_return();
		
    Error Details
	1. After running the client was getting error.
	The ServiceClass object does not implement the required method in the following form: OMElement add(OMElement e)
	2. Modify service.xml in webservice project as 
	WEB-INF->services->MyService -> META-INF -> services.xml
