1. Webservice clients using Axis1 implementation

   1.1 Type of webservice client
    
   1.1.1 Proxy based clients
   If client generates stub on client side and uses it in the application to make webservice call
   
   1.1.2 DII Clients(Dynamic invokation interface client)
   Clients never generate stub. Webservice API provider(Axis1,Axis2) provides set of classes which acts as stub 
   and is used by client to make webservice call
   
   
   ** Input for client is wsdl url  or  physical wsdl file.
   ** End Point url is location where webservice is running.
   ** Using wsdl file client generates stub or proxies to invoke webservice.
   ** Client creates client application may be web client or standalone program which uses stub or proxy classes.
   ** Eclipse uses Axis1's stub generation tool to generate stub using wsdl file. 
   
   
   1.2 How to create webservice client in eclipse
   
   Steps at a high level
   ** Create java project
   ** Copy wsdl file into client project
   ** generate stub or proxies
   ** Create TestClient.java with main method and use generated stubs/proxies in method to invoke webservice
   
      
   Steps in Detail
   ** Create Java Project(CalServiceClient)
   ** Copy wsdl file from webservice project into Client Project.(Directly under the project)
   ** Right click on Src folder->New->Other->WebService->WebService Client.
      Provide wsdl url or browse wsdl file as its already copied inside the folder
   ** Class ending with Stub is Stub and rest others are supporting classes.
   ** Whatever methods/interfaces are there in service class, same will be available in stub class.
   ** Target namespace is used to generate the package name in client project. package name is generated using 
      namespace in reverse direction
   ** Stub name is generated by adding Stub suffix to name attribute of <Wsdl:Binding> node.
   ** Client has to create Stub object using constructor to invoke webervice. Constructor requires two parameters, URL and Service object
       URL - java.net.URL
	   Service- Service class is given by Axis1.  org.apache.axis.client.Service
	   Webservice method is invoked on stub object.
