Array vs collection

Array
1. Fixed in length
2. Memory wise not recommended.
3. Performance wise recommended if we know the size.
4. can be used to store only homogeneous data type elements
5. No in-line method support for different operations
6. Can store primitive data type as well as object type(Int and Integer both)


Collection
1. Grow-able in nature
2. Memory wise recommended
3. Performance wise not recommended
4. can store both homogeneous and heterogeneous data type elements.
5. method support for every operations
every collection class is implemented based on some standard data structure and hence for every requirement ready made method support is available.
6. can store only object
