1. How to know git version
git --version

2. Configure global parameters
git config --global user.name "rajan kumar"
git config --global user.email "rajanbtechity@gmail.com"

3. To see list of configured parameters
git config --list

4. Inititalize a directory as git directory
git init 

5. check git status

git status

6. Add untracked files to git

git add .

7. commit changes to git
git commit -m "first commit"

8. Add files to remote directory
git remote add origin https://V536139@onestash.verizon.com/scm/~v536139/myresource.git

here origin is a name give to the remote connection.

9. push changes to remote directory
git push -u origin master


10. Check commit log

git log --oneline

git log


11. Checking out a file from an earlier commit

git checkout <commit's number> index.html

git checkout <commit's number>



12. The local branch had multiple commits which i am not able to push to remote. It gives this message

$ git push -u origin master
Branch master set up to track remote branch master from origin.
Everything up-to-date


The reason is local branch is not pointing to master branch. To check that do git branch

V536139@VIN0020ADKVTHEN MINGW64 /c/users/v536139/Project/PPSH/Notepad++/Learning ((d583220...))
$ git branch
* (HEAD detached from 7ed467a)
  master


Now what we can do it we can checkout the local commits into a new branch dg
git checkout -b dg
git branch
* dg
  master

Now we can push the new branch to remote. if this branch doesn't exit in remote it will create the new branch in remote.
git push -u origin dg




Now suppose we want only master branch in remote and no other branch. What we can do it we will create local branch dg which we did earlier. Then checkout master branch
using "git checkout master" and then we can merge dg branch into master and push this to remote.

git merge dg
$ git status
On branch master
Your branch is ahead of 'origin/master' by 2 commits.
  (use "git push" to publish your local commits)
nothing to commit, working directory clean




V536139@VIN0020ADKVTHEN MINGW64 /c/users/v536139/Project/PPSH/Notepad++/Learning (master)
$ git log --oneline

13. check git branch
git branch

14. create a new branch
git checkout -b dg

15. push a branch to remote 
git push -u origin dg          -->dg branch is being pushed
git push -u origin master      -->master branch is being pushed
